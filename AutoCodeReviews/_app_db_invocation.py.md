The code you've submitted contains a logical error related to the handling of `pipeline_invocation_id`. Specifically, the error arises from attempting to convert an `ObjectId` instance into an `ObjectId` again, which can cause a `TypeError`.

Here's the problematic line:

```python
invocation_data = await db.pipeline_invocations.find_one({"_id": ObjectId(pipeline_invocation_id)})
```

**Issue Explanation:**

- **Type Mismanagement**: The `pipeline_invocation_id` parameter is of type `PyObjectId`, which, based on common usage patterns, is likely a subclass or a type alias for `bson.ObjectId`. This means it's already an instance of `ObjectId`.
  
- **Redundant Conversion**: Passing an `ObjectId` instance to the `ObjectId()` constructor is unnecessary and can lead to errors. The `ObjectId()` constructor expects a `str`, `bytes`, or `ObjectId` compatible object. If you pass an `ObjectId` instance, it may raise a `TypeError` because it's not expecting to receive its own type as an argument.
  
- **Potential Exception**: If `pipeline_invocation_id` is indeed an `ObjectId`, then `ObjectId(pipeline_invocation_id)` would fail with a `TypeError`, effectively crashing the function whenever it's called with a valid `ObjectId`.

**Recommended Fix:**

- **Direct Usage**: Use the `pipeline_invocation_id` directly in the `find_one` query without attempting to convert it.

- **Updated Code:**

  ```python
  invocation_data = await db.pipeline_invocations.find_one({"_id": pipeline_invocation_id})
  ```

**Why This Fix Works:**

- **Type Consistency**: By using `pipeline_invocation_id` directly, you ensure that the `_id` field is compared with an `ObjectId` instance, which is the expected type in MongoDB for `_id` fields.

- **Avoiding Exceptions**: This change prevents the unnecessary and potentially error-inducing conversion, ensuring that the function works correctly with valid `ObjectId` inputs.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Input Validation**: If there's a possibility that `pipeline_invocation_id` might not be a valid `ObjectId`, consider adding validation logic to handle such cases gracefully.

- **Documentation**: Ensure that the expected type and format of `pipeline_invocation_id` is clearly documented, so callers of this function know how to provide the correct input.

**Revised Function:**

```python
async def get_invocation(
    pipeline_invocation_id: PyObjectId, db: AsyncIOMotorDatabase[Any]
) -> PipelineInvocationHistory:
    invocation_data = await db.pipeline_invocations.find_one({"_id": pipeline_invocation_id})

    if invocation_data is None:
        raise ValueError("Invocation with this ID does not exist")

    invocation = PipelineInvocationHistory(**invocation_data)

    return invocation
```

By making this change, you address the logical error and ensure that the function operates as intended when provided with a valid `PyObjectId`.
