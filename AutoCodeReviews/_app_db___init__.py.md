**Code Review:**

The proposed change adds an empty `__init__.py` file to the `app/db` directory:

```diff
diff --git a/app/db/__init__.py b/app/db/__init__.py
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e69de29
```

**Analysis:**

- **Purpose of `__init__.py`:** In Python packages, an `__init__.py` file is used to indicate that a directory is a Python package. This file can be empty or can execute initialization code for the package.

- **Empty `__init__.py`:** Adding an empty `__init__.py` is common and acceptable when no package-level initialization is required. It ensures compatibility with Python versions prior to 3.3, where the presence of this file is necessary for the directory to be recognized as a package.

**Logical Considerations:**

- **Package Recognition:** Ensuring that `app/db` is recognized as a package is essential if modules within this directory need to be imported elsewhere in the application. Without `__init__.py`, there might be import errors in certain Python versions or environments.

- **No Logical Errors Found:** Since the file is intentionally empty and serves the purpose of package recognition, there are no logical errors in this addition.

**Conclusion:**

- **Approval:** The addition of the empty `__init__.py` file is appropriate and necessary for proper package recognition. There are no logical issues with this change.

**Recommendation:**

- **Proceed with Merge:** This change can be merged as it correctly sets up `app/db` as a Python package without introducing any logical errors.
