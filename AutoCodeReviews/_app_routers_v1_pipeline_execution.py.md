There is a potential logical error in the `websocket_execute_pipeline_from_state` function regarding the construction of the `client_id`. In this function, the `client_id` is constructed as:

```python
client_id = f"{pipeline_id}:{identifier}:{str(user_id)}"
```

This is the same as in the existing `websocket_endpoint_pipeline` and `websocket_endpoint_draft` functions. However, the new function introduces an additional parameter `pipeline_invocation_id`, which is important for distinguishing between different execution states of the same pipeline.

**Issue:**

If a user initiates multiple pipeline executions from different saved states (i.e., different `pipeline_invocation_id`s) but with the same `pipeline_id`, `identifier`, and `user_id`, they will end up with the same `client_id`. This can lead to conflicts and overlapping connections within the `ConnectionManager`. Specifically:

- **Connection Management Conflict:** The `ConnectionManager` might overwrite the existing connection associated with the `client_id`, leading to disconnections or message delivery issues.
- **Message Routing Issues:** Messages intended for one execution state might be misrouted to another, causing confusion and incorrect execution flows.

**Recommendation:**

To resolve this issue, the `client_id` should include the `pipeline_invocation_id` to ensure that each client connection is uniquely identified. Here's the adjusted code:

```python
client_id = f"{pipeline_id}:{identifier}:{pipeline_invocation_id}:{str(user_id)}"
```

By including `pipeline_invocation_id`:

- **Unique Identification:** Each WebSocket connection is uniquely identified, even if the same user is executing the same pipeline and identifier but from different saved states.
- **Accurate Connection Management:** The `ConnectionManager` can accurately manage each connection without unintended overlaps or conflicts.
- **Correct Message Delivery:** Messages and events are properly routed to the correct client connection, ensuring the integrity of the pipeline execution process.

**Revised Function with Correction:**

```python
@router.websocket("/{pipeline_id}/identifier/{identifier}/{pipeline_invocation_id}")
async def websocket_execute_pipeline_from_state(
    websocket: WebSocket,
    pipeline_id: str,
    identifier: str,
    pipeline_invocation_id: str,
    db: AsyncIOMotorDatabase[Any] = Depends(get_db)
) -> None:
    """
    Endpoint to start a pipeline execution from a saved execution state
    """
    connection_manager = ConnectionManager()
    user_id = websocket.state.user.userId
    # Include pipeline_invocation_id in client_id to uniquely identify the connection
    client_id = f"{pipeline_id}:{identifier}:{pipeline_invocation_id}:{str(user_id)}"

    try:
        await connection_manager.connect(websocket, client_id)
        await execute_pipeline_from_state(
            websocket, 
            user_id, 
            PyObjectId(pipeline_id), 
            identifier, 
            PyObjectId(pipeline_invocation_id), 
            db, 
            client_id
        )

        await connection_manager.send_message(
            {"type": "completed", "data": "Pipeline execution completed"}, 
            client_id
        )
    except ValueError as e:
        # These are actual pipeline errors that the client should know about
        await connection_manager.send_message({"type": "error", "data": str(e)}, client_id)
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        logger.info(f"Client disconnected: {client_id}")
    except Exception as e:
        # These are errors that shouldn't happen and are probably logic errors in the code
        logger.error(f"Error in websocket connection: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    finally:
        await connection_manager.disconnect(client_id)
```

**Benefits of the Correction:**

- **Isolation of Connections:** Each pipeline execution from a different state runs in its own isolated WebSocket connection.
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple concurrent executions of the same pipeline without interference.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Prevents unintended side effects or errors due to overlapping `client_id`s.

**Conclusion:**

Including `pipeline_invocation_id` in the `client_id` is essential to avoid logical errors related to connection management and ensure that each pipeline execution from a saved state is handled correctly and independently.
